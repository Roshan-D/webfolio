hi! I'm Roshan. I'm curious about the world and how it can be changed with technology. I thought I'd start by telling you a little about myself and how I like to work.

Currently, I'm based out of SF and working at Robinhood! My current goal is to get into YCombinator, and I'm applying every cycle until I get in :D

## dream

My lifelong dream has been to be an entrepreneur, and im currently trying to make that happen! I think writing about my journey is a great way to keep myself accountable, and I hope to use this to document my journey from nothing to something. I'm not sure how long it'll take me to get there, but I'm excited to see where this journey takes me.

## journey

I grew up in suburban Atlanta, and I eventually found my way to Georgia Tech studying Computer Science. There, I learned most of what I know about software engineering from an organization i was a part of called [Hexlabs](https://hexlabs.org). I built tech for hackathons, and I learned a lot about building products for actual users. I did a couple internships in college, and ultimately ended up enjoying my time at Robinhood so much so that I dropped out of my master's program to work there. During my last semester of college, I went through [CreateX](https://create-x.gatech.edu/) and got my first taste of building startups working on Soloflow. It was a great learning experience, and made it clear to me that this is the path I want to take.

## how i work

- I work best in-person and face-to-face.
- I highly value focus time, and strive to be available and responsive anytime outside of that.
- I believe in direct feedback, and really appreciate people who both give it and are receptive to it.
- Honesty is my #1 policy, so you can expect me to be completely transparent with you.

## for fun

In my free time, I love to practice calisthenics, run long distances, read, and bake! Please reach out if you train calisthenics, I'd love to build a community in SF :D

## contact me
